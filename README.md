This repository also contains **blend-settings**, a tool for configuring blend and overlays, as well as many other utilities. 

## Credits

The `init-blend` file in this repository uses a few lines (the sections have been clearly) uses from distrobox's init script. These lines have been marked and attributed appropriately, and are licensed under [the GPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/COPYING.md).

I would also like to thank Luca Di Maio from Distrobox for NVIDIA driver support in containers.

Aside from these lines, all the other code in this repository has been written by me (rs2009). `blend-settings` is based on [Modren](https://github.com/RudraSwat/modren), a software store I (rs2009) had written long ago, and is licensed under the same license as the rest of the code in this repository, [the GPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/blend-os/blend/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Usage

It's recommended to use the `blend-settings` UI, instead of the `blend` CLI.
